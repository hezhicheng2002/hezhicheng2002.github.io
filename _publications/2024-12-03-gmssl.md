We propose a Graph Matching Based Graph Self-Supervised Learning (GMSSL) framework, which aims to comprehensively learn the structure and semantics of molecular graphs. Utilizing intra-graph and inter-graph convolution and graph matching methods, GMSSL demonstrates powerful molecular property prediction on multiple datasets.
