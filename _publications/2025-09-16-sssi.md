We propose a self-prompted segmentation of scientific illustrations (SSSI) framework, which automatically utilizes the geometric relationships between text and subregions to generate point and bounding box prompts suitable for SAM. SSSI employs a two-stage processing pipeline for segmenting complex flowcharts in scientific papers.
