This paper provides a comparative analysis of two excellent models, LXMERT and UNITER, evaluating their performance on visual question answering (VQA) tasks. The study demonstrates the reasons for performance differences on specific downstream tasks and provides insight into the possibility of further model optimization for multi-modal tasks.
