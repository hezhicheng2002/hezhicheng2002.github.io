Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) is highly valued for its non-invasive and painless approach, though its effectiveness is compromised by uneven illumination from hardware constraints and complex internal dynamics. We introduce EndoUIC, a WCE unified illumination correction solution using an end-to-end promptable diffusion transformer (DiT) model.
