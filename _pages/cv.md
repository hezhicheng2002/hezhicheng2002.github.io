Education
======
* B.S. in Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, 2025
* Master of Engineering in National University of Singapore, 2027

Selected Research Experience
======
* **2024.01 - 2025.04: Document Content Extraction and Comprehension Using LLM**
  * **Advisor: Prof. Xiaoqing Lv, Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology, Peking University**
  * Developed an email parsing and recommendation system using LLM libraries like SpaCy and keyBERT to evaluate
keyword importance and grammatical weights, creating a service that parses subscribed arXiv alerts; realized the delivery of personalized recommendation lists of research articles based on the parsed data.

* **2024.01 - 2024.10: Orthodontics Image Classification Based on Adapter Learning**
  * **Advisor: Prof. Hongliang Ren, the Chinese University of Hong Kong**
  * Engaged in the adapter learning based orthodontics image classification using MMPretrain to train mainstream pipelines including ResNet50, Vision Transformer, Swin Transformer, and Surgical-Dino for classifying orthodontic diseases.

* **2024.07 - 2024.10: Multi-view Contrastive Learning of Medical Time Series Prediction Pretraining**
  * **Advisor: Prof. Tengfei Ma, the Stony Brook University**
  * Implemented the ViTST and PatchTST models on PAMAP2 dataset and extracted feature representations for contrast learning, while integrated both views into one potential space.
