I'm a fourth year undergraduate student from [School of CS](https://cs.bjtu.edu.cn/), [Beijing Jiaotong University](https://www.bjtu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes medical image processing, large language model and artificial intelligence.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xiaoqing Lv](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37599114400) of [Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology](https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University. Meanwhile, I am honored to be recommended by [Prof. Hongliang Ren](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/people/academic-staff/professors/prof-ren-hongliang) of [Ren Lab](http://www.labren.org/mm/) from The Chinese University of Hong Kong. Moreover, I am  thrilled to be instructed by [Prof. Tengfei Ma](https://ai.stonybrook.edu/people/faculty/TengfeiMa) of Department of Biomedical Informatics from Stony Brook University, who also agreed to be my recommender.
